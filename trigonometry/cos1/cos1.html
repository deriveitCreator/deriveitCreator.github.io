<header id="mainheader2" style="background-color:white"><h1>Proof Of The Subtraction Formulas</h1></header>
<p class="pmain">Before reading the proof, you must be familiar with the cosine rule, if not then <a target="_blank"
href="../cosine_rule/cosine_rule.html" style="color:blue">click here</a>. Imagine two <span style="color:#F17707">lines
</span>with the length of 1, one of them is raised by angle <span style="color:#CC0099">j</span> from the x-axis and
the other is raised by angle <span style="color:purple">k</span>. Lets call the end points of the two <span
style="color:#F17707">lines</span> <span style="color:orange">A</span> and <span style="color:orange">B</span>:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="first.png">
<p class="pmain">Let there be a <span style="color:green">green line</span>, which connects from <span
style="color:orange">A</span> to <span style="color:orange">B</span>. We will call the length of this <span
style="color:green">line</span> <span style="color:maroon">c</span>:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="green.png">
<p class="pmain">Using the cosine rule, we know that:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="e.png">
<p class="pmain">Now lets make a <span style="color:gray">horizontal line</span> at <span style="color:orange">point
A</span> and a <span style="color:gray">vertical line</span> at <span style="color:orange">point B</span>:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="hv.png">
<p class="pmain">You will notice that a triangle has been formed with the <span style="color:green">green line</span>
as the hypotenuse, so using the Pythagoras' theorem:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="pt.png">
<p class="pmain">Looking at the graph, we know that the length of the <span style="color:gray">horizontal leg</span> is
[<span style="color:#006699">cos(<span style="color:#CC0099">j</span>) <span style="color:black">-</span> cos(<span
style="color:purple">k</span>)</span>] and that the length of the <span style="color:gray">vertical leg</span> is
[<span style="color:#3366FF">sin(<span style="color:#CC0099">j</span>) <span style="color:black">-</span> sin(<span
style="color:purple">k</span>)</span>], so we can rewrite the above equation as:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="e2.png">
<p class="pmain">Using the cosine rule and the Pythagoras' theorem, we get two equations for <span
style="color:maroon">c<sup>2</sup></span>:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="two.png">
<p class="pmain">From these two we get:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="third.png">
<p class="pmain">This is the subtraction formula for cosine, as for sine:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="lol.png">
<p class="pmain">Since [<span style="color:#006699">cos(<span style="color:red">x</span>)</span> = <span
style="color:#3366FF">sin(<span style="color:red">x + 90</span>)</span>], we can say that [<span
style="color:#006699">cos(<span style="color:red">x - 90</span>)</span> = <span style="color:#3366FF">sin(<span
style="color:red">x</span>)</span>]. Therefore:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="sine5.png">
<p class="pmain">Since [<span style="color:#006699">cos(<span style="color:red">90 - x</span>)</span> = <span
style="color:#3366FF">sin(<span style="color:red">x</span>)</span>] and [<span style="color:#3366FF">sin(<span
style="color:red">90 - x</span>)</span> = <span style="color:#006699">cos(<span style="color:red">x</span>)</span>],
we can conclude:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="sine6.png">
<p class="pmain">And that is the subtraction formula for sine. Now lets divide <span style="color:#3366FF">sin(<span
style="color:#CC0099">j</span> - <span style="color:purple">k</span>)</span> by <span style="color:#006699">cos(<span
style="color:#CC0099">j</span> - <span style="color:purple">k</span>)</span>:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="tan1.png">
<p class="pmain">Now lets divide both the numerator and the denominator by <span style="color:#006699">cos(<span
style="color:#CC0099">j</span>)cos(<span style="color:purple">k</span>)</span>:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="tan2.png">
<p class="pmain">We already know that <span style="color:#11BBDD">tan(<span style="color:red">x</span>)</span> is
[<span style="color:#3366FF">sin(<span style="color:red">x</span>)</span>/<span style="color:#006699">cos(<span
style="color:red">x</span>)</span>], so:</p>
<img alt="Images in this website are important, and there is suppose to be an image here." class="displayimg" src="tan3.png">
<p class="pmain">And that is the subtraction formula for <span style="color:#11BBDD">tan(<span
style="color:red">x</span>)</span>.</p>
