<h3>History Of Fermentation:</h3>

<p class="pmain2">Over the course of human history, and using a system of trial, error, and careful
observation, different cultures began producing fermented beverages. Mead, or honey wine, was produced in
Asia during the Vedic period (around 1700–1100 BC), and the Greeks, Celts, Saxons, and Vikings also produced
this beverage.</p>

<p class="pmain2">At the time, people knew that leaving fruits and grains in covered containers for a long
time produced wine and beer, but no one fully understood why the recipe worked. The process was named
fermentation, from the Latin word fervere, which means "to boil." The name came from the observation that
mixtures of crushed grapes kept in large vessels produced bubbles, as though they were boiling. Producing
fermented beverages was tricky. If the mixture did not stand long enough, the product contained no alcohol;
but if left for too long, the mixture rotted and was undrinkable. Through empirical observation, people
learned that temperature and air exposure are key to the fermentation process.</p>

<p class="pmain2">People across the world have enjoyed fermented foods and beverages like beer, wine, bread,
yogurt, cheese, and pickled vegetables for all of recorded history. Discoveries from several archeological
sites suggest that even prehistoric people took advantage of fermentation to preserve and enhance the taste
of food. Archaeologists studying pottery jars from a Neolithic village in China found that people were making
a fermented beverage from rice, honey, and fruit as early as 7000 BC.</p>

<p class="pmain2">While it is likely that people first learned about fermentation by accident—perhaps by drinking old milk that
had curdled or old grape juice that had fermented—they later learned to harness the power of fermentation to
make products like bread, cheese, and wine.</p>
