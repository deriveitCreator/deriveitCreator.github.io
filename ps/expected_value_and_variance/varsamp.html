<p class="pmain">For this derivation, you have to get familiar with these variables:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s1.PNG">
<p class="pmain">For a population of size N and values X<sub>i</sub>, the population variance and the sample variance are calculated using the formula below:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s2.PNG">
<p class="pmain">In many practical situations, the true variance of a population is not known a priori and must be computed somehow. When dealing with extremely large populations, it is not possible to count every object in the population. Lets try to derive an equation for the expected value of the population variance, E[&sigma;^2], using the sample mean rather than the population mean, and using the size of the sample n rather than the population size N. We start our derivation by the formula of variance:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s3.PNG">
<p class="pmain">The law of large numbers states that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean, so we are going to assume that E[X&#772;] = &mu; = E[X]. Also, in statistics, it is commonly assumed that observations in a sample are effectively iid, meaning that <b>all</b> the X<sub>i</sub> variables taken from the population will have the same variance as the population (&sigma;^2). We can rewrite our variance formula like this:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s4.PNG">
<p class="pmain">Since the observations are iid, then var[X&#772;] = (&sigma;^2)/n (click <a href="varMean.html">here</a> to learn why):</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s5.PNG">
<p class="pmain">Our next step is to find the sum of (X<sub>i</sub>-E[X&#772;])<sup>2</sup> (they are added n times):</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s6.PNG">
<p class="pmain">Since they are added n times, then X&#772; = &Sigma; X<sub>i</sub>/n:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s7.PNG">
<p class="pmain">We can use the linearity of expectation here:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s8.PNG">
<p class="pmain">We can substitute in the values we got ealier:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s9.PNG">
<p class="pmain">We can simplify this further:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s10.PNG">
<p class="pmain">Looks like we got the sum of (X<sub>i</sub>-E[X&#772;])<sup>2</sup> in very simple terms:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s11.PNG">
<p class="pmain">Lets make the population variance the subject of this equation:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s12.PNG">
<p class="pmain">The above equation tells us that when the sum of (X<sub>i</sub>-E[X&#772;])<sup>2</sup> is divided by (n - 1), we are expected to get the population variance. This is how we get the population variance using the sample mean and the sample size. If we multiply both sides with (n-1)/n, we get:</p>
<img class="displayimg" src="s13.PNG">
<p class="pmain">Hence the sample variance gives an estimate of the population variance that is biased by a factor of (n-1)/n. For this reason, the sum of (X<sub>i</sub>-E[X&#772;])<sup>2</sup>/n is referred to as the <span data-title="In statistics, the bias of an estimator is the difference between this estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated.">biased</span> sample variance. Using (n - 1) instead of n in the formula for sample variance yields the unbiased sample variance, this is called <b>Bessel's correction</b>.</p>
