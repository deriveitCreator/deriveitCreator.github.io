<p class="pmain">
    We know that the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, but that is only true for the interval (0, &infin;); that means (ln(x) + C) is the antiderivative of 1/x only on that interval. It would be better to say that the antiderivative of 1/x is (ln(|x|) + C), since that would work on any interval as long as x &ne; 0.
